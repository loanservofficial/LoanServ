    intro: [
      "An Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) is the fixed amount you repay to a lender every month until your loan is fully cleared. Each EMI has two parts: a portion that pays off the interest charged for the month and a portion that reduces the outstanding principal. In the early months most of your EMI goes towards interest, and as the balance falls, a larger share starts chipping away at the principal. This is why paying off a loan feels slow at first and speeds up towards the end of the tenure.",
      "Lenders in India calculate EMIs on a reducing-balance basis using the formula EMI = P x r x (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1), where P is the loan principal, r is the monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12, expressed as a decimal) and n is the number of monthly instalments. Because interest is charged only on the balance still owed, reducing-balance EMIs are far cheaper than flat-rate calculations, so always confirm which method a lender uses before comparing offers.",
      "Use this calculator to test different combinations of loan amount, interest rate and tenure. A longer tenure lowers the monthly EMI but raises the total interest you pay, while a shorter tenure does the opposite. Seeing these trade-offs in numbers helps you pick an EMI that fits your monthly budget without overpaying on interest across the life of the loan.",

The challenge is that your expenses will keep rising with inflation, so the corpus you need decades from now is far larger than today's costs suggest. This calculator estimates the total corpus required at retirement and the amount you should invest each month to build it, given your current expenses, expected inflation and investment returns.",
      "The maths works in stages. First, today's monthly expenses are grown by inflation to your retirement age using future value, expense x (1 + inflation)^years. Then the corpus needed to fund those inflated expenses through retirement is estimated, allowing for returns during the retirement years. Finally, the required monthly investment is found using the SIP future value formula, so you know how much to save today to reach that target comfortably.",
      "Two forces dominate retirement planning: inflation, which quietly erodes purchasing power, and compounding, which rewards those who start early. Beginning in your twenties or thirties means a modest monthly investment can grow into a large corpus, whereas starting late demands much heavier saving. Because returns and inflation are assumptions, revisit your plan periodically. Combining equity for growth in early years with safer instruments closer to retirement is a common, sensible strategy.",
